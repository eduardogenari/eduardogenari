### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi! I am a junior developer and a senior designer.

Having grown up as an architect, I have always been at the intersection of design, business and technology. Now I am focused on building modern digital products.

I am currently working on a huge IBM project, migrating applications from the clientâ€™s DC to AWS.

And I am also finishing my React bootcamp and interested in Vue.js, Node.js, MongoDB, Figma, Sketch, Wordpress, Shopify, Blockchain, Web3 and NFT.
