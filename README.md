### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Edu, Full-Stack Developer and Product Designer at IThinkUPC, the consulting company and advanced digital services provider of the UPC - Polytechnic University of Catalonia.

Having grown up as an architect, I have always been at the intersection of design, business and technology. Now I am focused on building modern digital products, currently working on a huge project for a public spanish company using Java, Angular and MySQL.
